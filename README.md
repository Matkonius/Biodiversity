# Biodiversity 
Hello, I am glad that you have opened this portfolio project. My goal was here to analyze the biodiversity of  4 national parks in the US. In this file, you can find:
1. Input data (.csv)
2. Analysis in Jupyter notebook (I have exported it to HTML and put it to output/encloser).
3. Output (contains the result of my analysis)
    a. Presentation (here I summarise everything)
    b. Encloser (it contain made graphs and code exported to HTML â€“ you can open it in your browser)
Feel free to explore it how much you want. If you are not sure about anything, don't be afraid to ask. My mail is matejkonecny@me.com, and it will be a pleasure to answer your questions.
